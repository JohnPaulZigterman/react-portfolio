        <p>
          John is an aspiring fullstack developer with a passion for problem solving and tackling new ideas.
          That's me by the way, John Zigterman. I got into coding because it seemed like a natural fit
          after spending years learning about audio engineering and developing my skills in a
          technical environment. I'm excited to bring my enthusiasm and determination to any
          new adventure, and always work hard to see the best possible outcome.
