# React Portfolio Project - John Zigterman

## Description

- I set out to create a portfolio in React JS that would showcase my projects and my development skills learned so far.
- I wanted to make a responsive and dynamic portfolio that was impressive in both design and functionality.
- I used a NavBar system to dynamically load seperate pages on one React Outlet to create a smooth experience.
- I took it upon myself to develop this as not just an expression of my skills, but of the type of enthusiasm and style I bring to a project.

## Installation

This is a deployed web page and can be viewed publicly by anyone at the provided link.

## Usage

You may use my portfolio to track my progress as a developer, and stay alert on new projects I've been tinkering with.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
